# Tools

beater.js tools are first-party code declared by an agent and exposed through the same registry that powers Anthropic tool calls and `/mcp`.

## Agent declarations

`agents/<name>/agent.ts` imports helpers from `beater:agent`:

```ts
import { browserTool, defineAgent, pyTool, remoteMcpTool, rustTool, wasmtimeTool } from "beater:agent";

export default defineAgent({
  name: "support",
  model: "claude-opus-4-8",
  system: "Use tools for data work.",
  tools: [
    pyTool("summarize_numbers", "./tools/summarize_numbers.py", {
      idempotent: true,
    }),
    rustTool("get_time"),
  ],
});
```

Tool names are global within the served app registry. If two agents declare the same tool name, the first loaded tool wins and the duplicate is logged.

## Python tools

Python tools are `.py` files loaded into embedded CPython. Each file must define:

- `TOOL`: metadata with `description` and `input_schema`.
- `run(input)`: function that accepts a JSON-like Python object and returns a JSON-serializable object.

Example:

```py
TOOL = {
    "description": "Summarize a list of numbers.",
    "input_schema": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "numbers": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "number"}},
        },
        "required": ["numbers"],
    },
}

def run(input):
    nums = [float(n) for n in input["numbers"]]
    return {"count": len(nums), "sum": sum(nums)}
```

The tool file is executed in a fresh namespace for every call, so code edits are picked up without restarting. Runtime packages come from the configured venv's `site-packages`, and that venv must match the embedded Python minor version reported by `beater doctor`.

## Rust tools

Rust tools are built into the host binary. Current built-ins:

- `get_time`: returns the current UTC time as JSON.

Rust built-ins are idempotent by default because they are first-party host code with no external side effects unless explicitly implemented otherwise.

## Wasmtime tools

Use `wasmtimeTool` for untrusted scalar wasm functions that do not need host capabilities:

```ts
wasmtimeTool("double_wasm", {
  source: {
    kind: "wasm_wat",
    text: `
      (module
        (func (export "run") (param i64) (result i64)
          local.get 0
          i64.const 2
          i64.mul))
    `,
  },
  description: "Double an integer in the local Wasmtime sandbox.",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {n: {type: "integer"}},
    required: ["n"],
  },
  policy: {
    limits: {wall_ms: 1000, memory_bytes: 1048576, fuel: 100000},
  },
  idempotent: true,
})
```

The first Wasmtime tier is hermetic: no WASI, no host imports, no filesystem mounts, no network, no environment variables, and no secrets. Supported entrypoints are `run() -> ()`, `run() -> i64`, and `run(i64) -> i64`; the one-argument form accepts either a raw integer input or `{n: integer}`. Broader capability-scoped WASI handles and richer value passing are future work.

## Idempotency

Every non-read-only tool must be explicit about idempotency. This is the crash-resume contract:

- `idempotent: true`: beater may re-run the tool after a crash if the journal has a started tool step without a completed result. The tool should use the `tool_use_id` as an idempotency key when it talks to external systems.
- `idempotent: false`: beater will not re-run the tool after a crash. The run is parked as `needs_review` so a human can inspect whether the side effect happened.

Use `idempotent: false` for tools that send email, charge money, mutate external records, start browser sessions, or call APIs that cannot be safely de-duplicated.

## Integration roadmap

Remote MCP servers and browser-control providers enter through the same registry shape: name, description, input schema, implementation kind, timeout/retry policy, secret source, egress allowlist, and idempotency. They should not bypass the journal. Remote MCP tools are mock-server tested. Browser tools currently include a mock CDP provider for contract, cleanup, and agent-loop tests; production Playwright/CDP providers still need real browser e2e coverage.

## Remote MCP tools

Use `remoteMcpTool` for networked MCP providers:

```ts
remoteMcpTool("crm.lookup", {
  endpoint: "https://mcp.crm.example/mcp",
  tool: "lookup_contact",
  description: "Look up a CRM contact.",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {email: {type: "string"}},
    required: ["email"],
  },
  auth: {type: "bearer", env: "CRM_MCP_TOKEN"},
  timeoutMs: 10_000,
  retry: {attempts: 2, backoffMs: 250, idempotencyKey: "tool_use_id"},
  egress: ["mcp.crm.example"],
  idempotent: true,
})
```

Secrets are read from environment variables at execution time and are never stored in `agent.ts` or the journal. Missing secrets fail before a network connection is opened. Bearer-auth endpoints must use HTTPS except for loopback test servers. The endpoint host must match `egress`; use `host` or `host:port` entries. Redirects are not followed.

## Browser tools

Use `browserTool` for browser-provider declarations. The current `mock_cdp` provider is deterministic and intended for CI coverage of the browser contract:

```ts
browserTool("browser.checkout", {
  provider: "mock_cdp",
  description: "Verify checkout in a browser.",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {url: {type: "string"}, task: {type: "string"}},
    required: ["url", "task"],
  },
  session: {scope: "run", cleanup: "always"},
  allowedOrigins: ["https://shop.example"],
  timeoutMs: 30_000,
  idempotent: false,
})
```

Browser tools default to non-idempotent because they create sessions and may perform side effects. `allowedOrigins` is enforced before navigation, and mock sessions are per tool call with cleanup on success, failure, and timeout. `mock_cdp` rejects non-empty `secrets`; real providers must validate and scope credentials explicitly.

See [Integration Registry](integrations.md) for the full contract and target declaration shapes.
